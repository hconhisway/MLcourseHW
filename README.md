# MLcourseHW1
This is a machine learning library developed by Chang Han for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

### How to Use
Run decisionTree.py to get results from HW1. Adjust total_attr based on the # of attrs in dataset, also adjust max_depth accordingly.

Run EnsemL with AdaBoost or Bagged set as True to run corresponding tasks.

Run RandomForest with Normal or Estimate True to run 2 (d) 2(e).

Run GD.py or SGD.py to get results from HW2 4(a) 4(b) separately. Analytical form is also implemented in SGD.

Run perceptron.py and variants with corresponding name in folder Perceptron for HW3.
